mines in some of the cells. The goal of the game is to open all the cells that don't contain mines 
without triggering any of the mines in the shortest time possible. in easy mode You can also win by 
having all the mines marked with flag (f), but you must have atleat opened one cell.

Gameplay

You open a cell by selecting it and pressing the enter key, when the cell is opened it will check the 
number of cells with mines around the cell like so.

X is the selected cell.

 |_||_||_|
 |_||X||_|
 |_||_||_|

X will be the number of cells around the opened cell are mines Ex.

 |_||M||_|
 |_||2||_|
 |M||_||_|

If there are no mines around the selected cell no number will be shown and the 4 cells that are connected 
are opened autometicly as well. If a cell that contains a mine is opened all the mines explode and you 
lose the game.

You can flag(Mark) a cell that you think has a mine, this is mostly to help you narrow down where the
mines are. You can cycle between a F mark or a ? mark, also marked cells can not be opened by the player
this is so thet you dont open a cell that you think is a mine by mistake :P

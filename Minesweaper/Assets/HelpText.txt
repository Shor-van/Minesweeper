&6without triggering any of the mines in the shortest time possible. in easy mode You can also win by 
&6having all the mines marked with flag (&4f&6), but you must have atleat opened one cell.

&3Gameplay

&6You open a cell by selecting it and pressing the enter key, when the cell is opened it will check the 
&6number of cells with mines around the cell like so.

&3X &6is the selected cell.

 &6|_||_||_|
 &6|_||&3X&6||_|
 &6|_||_||_|

&3X &6will be the number of cells around the opened cell are mines Ex.

 &6|_||&2M&6||_|
 &6|_||&32&6||_|
 &6|&2M&6||_||_|

&6If there are no mines around the selected cell no number will be shown and the 4 cells that are connected 
&6are opened autometicly as well. If a cell that contains a mine is opened all the mines explode and you 
&6lose the game.

&6You can flag(Mark) a cell that you think has a mine, this is mostly to help you narrow down where the
&6mines are. You can cycle between a F mark or a ? mark, also marked cells can not be opened by the player
&6this is so thet you dont open a cell that you think is a mine by mistake :P
